## 📝 1-Minute Self-Introduction (Final Version)

Hello everyone, my name is **Vinayak Sharma**.

I am a 2023 batch student of **Computer Science Engineering** with a specialization in **E-Commerce**. I have a strong interest in technology-driven business solutions and digital platforms.

My core technical skills include **Java** and **Python**, which I use to build efficient and structured solutions. I have worked on a **CRM project**, where I gained practical experience in managing customer data, understanding business workflows, and developing system logic.

In addition to this, I have good knowledge of **Unity Hub**, which has helped me explore interactive development and strengthen my understanding of digital environments and application structure.

As a CSE student specializing in E-Commerce, I am particularly interested in how technology enhances online business models and improves customer experience. I am always eager to learn, adapt, and contribute to innovative solutions.

Thank you.
